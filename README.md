Solana NFT Airdrop Automation Toolkit
A comprehensive suite of tools for automating NFT airdrops on the Solana blockchain. This toolkit streamlines the process of distributing digital assets to token holders while ensuring transparency and efficiency.

Features
Holder Identification - Filter token holders excluding exchange wallets

Batch NFT Generation - Create multiple editions from master NFTs

Randomized Selection - Fair distribution through randomized recipient selection

Automated Distribution - Bulk sending of NFTs to recipient wallets

Transparency Tools - Generate verifiable distribution logs

Error Recovery - Resume interrupted airdrops from last successful transaction

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm/yarn

Rust and Cargo

Solana CLI tools

Third-party RPC provider (recommended for large airdrops)

Core utilities: gshuf, jq

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nft-airdrop-automation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build Metaplex tools (if using customized Metaplex)
cd metaplex/rust
cargo build
Configuration
Update the Makefile with your specific configuration:

makefile
METAPLEX_PATH = /path/to/your/metaplex
KEYFILE = /path/to/your/solana/wallet.json
RPC_HOST = https://your-rpc-provider.com
Workflow
1. Prepare Holder Data
bash
# Collect token mint addresses from your NFT collection
# Store as token-mint-addresses.json in root directory
2. Identify Eligible Holders
bash
make record DROP=1 TYPE=special_edition
Excludes wallets from major exchanges (Digital Eyes, Magic Eden, Solanart, Alpha Art)

3. Create Master NFT
bash
# Use Metaplex to create your master edition NFT
cd metaplex/js && npm start
4. Generate NFT Editions
bash
make generate MINT=YOUR_MASTER_MINT_ADDRESS NUM=1000 TYPE=special_edition
5. Select Recipients
bash
make choose NUM=500 TYPE=special_edition
Randomly selects recipients from eligible holders

6. Distribute NFTs
bash
make distribute TYPE=special_edition
# Resume from specific index if needed
make distribute TYPE=special_edition STARTINDEX=250
7. Handle Errors (Optional)
bash
# Burn mistakenly created NFTs
make burn TYPE=special_edition
Transparency and Verification
We recommend maintaining a transparency repository showing:

Airdrop receipts and transaction logs

Verification data for community auditing

Distribution statistics and metrics

Example structure:

text
transparency/
├── day1/
│   ├── recipients.json
│   ├── transactions.log
│   └── verification.md
└── day2/
    └── ...
Important Considerations
Cost Awareness: Test on devnet first to understand fee structures

Exchange Limitations: Some exchanges use unique escrow systems that may not be detectable

Wallet Security: Use dedicated wallets for airdrop operations

Community Communication: Be transparent about your airdrop process
